    "  Imagine that you work for a financial institution and part of your job is to build a model that predicts if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. You can model the problem as a binary classification problem. A transaction belongs to the positive class (1) if it is a fraud, otherwise it belongs to the negative class (0).\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>You have access to transactions that occured over a certain period of time. The majority of the transactions are normally legitimate and only a small fraction are non-legitimate. Thus, typically you have access to a dataset that is highly unbalanced. This is also the case of the current dataset: only 492 transactions out of 284,807 are fraudulent (the positive class - the frauds - accounts for 0.172% of all transactions).\n",
